# APP_1 Expected Output 
## Every second, you should see messages from the random_data_thread indicating the number of bytes added to the buffer:

### Added 48 bytes, buffer size: 48
### Added 33 bytes, buffer size: 81
...
## Every 10 seconds, you should see messages from the print_data_thread checking the buffer size and printing data if there are at least 512 bytes:

# APP_2 Expected Output
## Every second, the random_data_thread will generate random bytes and attempt to put them in the message queue. If the queue is full, a message will indicate that the message is dropped. Every 10 seconds, the print_data_thread will print all data currently in the message queue.
### Printing data:
### 3c 7a 5e 4f ...
### Total bytes printed: 512
...
### No data to print.
