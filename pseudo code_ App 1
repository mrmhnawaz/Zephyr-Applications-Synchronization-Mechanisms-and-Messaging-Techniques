1. Define global variables:
   - data_buffer[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE]: array to store generated bytes
   - buffer_size: variable to track the current size of the buffer
   - buffer_mutex: mutex for synchronizing access to the buffer

2. Create two threads:
   - Thread 1:
     - Periodically wakes up (every 1 second)
     - Generates random number of bytes (up to 50 bytes)
     - Adds generated bytes to the data_buffer
     - Ensures thread-safe access to the buffer using buffer_mutex

   - Thread 2:
     - Periodically wakes up (every 10 seconds)
     - Checks if 512 bytes are stored in the data_buffer
     - If yes, prints the latest 512 bytes in hex format
     - Deletes the printed bytes from the buffer
     - Ensures thread-safe access to the buffer using buffer_mutex

3. Assumptions:
   - Random number generation is done using sys_rand32_get()
   - Buffer management ensures thread safety using mutex
   - No messaging techniques are used, only synchronization mechanisms
