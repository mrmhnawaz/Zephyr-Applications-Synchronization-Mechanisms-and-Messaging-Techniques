1. Define a message structure containing:
   - data: array to store generated bytes
   - length: variable to track the length of the data

2. Create two threads:
   - Thread 1:
     - Periodically wakes up (every 1 second)
     - Generates random number of bytes (up to 50 bytes)
     - Packs the generated bytes into a message structure
     - Sends the message to a message queue for Thread 2 to consume

   - Thread 2:
     - Periodically wakes up (every 10 seconds)
     - Receives messages from the message queue
     - Prints all bytes from received messages in hex format
     - Ensures all bytes are printed without using globally accessible data structure

3. Assumptions:
   - Random number generation is done using sys_rand32_get()
   - Message queues are used for inter-thread communication
   - No globally accessible data structures are used
